* Bootstrap  
* PostgresSQL

#### Collaboration and Approach Taken  

The project idea of a shop was created as a group. Github and all other technologies were worked on as a team and linked together. Initially the backend products page was created using postgresSQL and Django, then the user auth with bcrypt was created. Both of the databases and tables were linked together using a ForeignKey. The front end was then created using react with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 7 routes were created to show, create, edit, and delete each product, and to create, login, and delete each user.  
As a team we developed a structured workflow that allowed us to work in separate files simultaneously, with minimal merge conflicts. As a group at checkpoints we tested the files for errors Before pushing the product to the main branch of the application. Most of the styling was created with Bootstrap and assisted with CSS and inline styling for properties that were unable to be written in Bootstrap.

##### Unfinished Functionality

We were unable to add a cart function for someone to purchase the items and remove them from the list.  
Unable to figure out how to make one index full screen and hide all other indexes.
